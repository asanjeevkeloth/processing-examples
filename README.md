# Processing Examples  

This repository is a collection of my programs written in [processing](https://processing.org/). Processing is a high-level language like Java inclusive IDE. The language is especially for creating 2D and 3D graphics and animations. In addition it can be read user inputs and processing it. Also it exists many librarys for extending Processing. You can also write games and simulations with Processing.  

Here you can find the [documentation](https://processing.org/reference/)
